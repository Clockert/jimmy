            I believe that mountains are not merely obstacles to conquer but
            living landscapes to experience and respect. My approach to guiding
            combines technical expertise with environmental stewardship and
            cultural appreciation. Every expedition is an opportunity to connect
            deeply with nature while ensuring the highest standards of safety
            and responsible outdoor practices.
